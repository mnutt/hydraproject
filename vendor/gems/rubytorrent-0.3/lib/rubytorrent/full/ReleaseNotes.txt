Release notes for 0.3:

Many more bug fixes. Speed is now basically comparable to Bram's client---at
least in my limited experiments. 

The following are known issues with this release:

- Ruby threads don't play well with curses. Non-blocking getch hangs.
  See [ruby-talk:130620]. So we use ncurses.

- Ruby threads don't play well with TCP sockets on Windows. There is a
  20-second *global* freeze every time an outgoing connection is made to a
  non-responsive host. See [ruby-talk:129578], [ruby-core:04364]. As you can
  imagine, this can be quite a performance hit in a program that can make
  potentially hundreds of such connections. In fact, it renders RubyTorrent
  almost useless on Windows. A patch exists (indeed, has existed for many
  months), and if I bug Matz maybe it'll get in to 1.8.3. :)

- Ruby threads don't play well with writing data over TCP sockets. At least,
  that's what I glean from [ruby-talk:130480], and it might explain the
  occasional freezing behavior I see (3 to 30 seconds, sporadic) under heavy
  loads in Linux.

Other than that :) everything works. I think.
